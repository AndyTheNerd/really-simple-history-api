<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>I wanted to write a 'this day in history' twitter bot, which posts events which 
happened on this day.  There's a few people on Twitter doing this already, but I
am lazy and wanted to automate it.</p>

<p>Luckily, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_anniversaries">Wikipedia</a>
has entries for each day of the year.  I wrote a parser to turn this into JSON data, and a very
simple Sinatra app to spit out that data for any given day.</p>

<p>Just for kicks, I wrote a pretty simple JS interface as well.  You can see it in action on
the <a href="/today">Today's History</a> page.</p>


<h3>How To Use</h3>
<p>Get today's history in JSON format at <a href="/date">/date</a></p>
<p>Get another day's history in JSON at <strong>/date/month/day</strong> where month and day are numbers.
   For example, <a href="/date/2/14">/date/2/14</a> to get the history for February 14th.
</p>

<p>The data is split into births, deaths, and events.  Each element is a hash with 
   one 'text' field.  I might add a URL or some other fields later.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="/api.js">the API javascript</a> or the
<a href="/today">history ticker</a> to see the code in use.</p>
